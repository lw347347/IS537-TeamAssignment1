        <br>1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of seeds of every kind, both of grain of
        every kind, and also of the seeds of fruit of every kind.
        <br>2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I
        have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.
        <br>3 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi
        and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.
        <br>4 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream,
        a dark and dreary wilderness.
        <br>5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a white robe; and he came and stood before me.
        <br>6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow him.
        <br>7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself that I was in a dark and dreary waste.
        <br>8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he
        would have mercy on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.
        <br>9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld a large and spacious field.
        <br>10 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was desirable to make one happy.
        <br>11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most
        sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all
        the whiteness that I had ever seen.
        <br>12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to
        be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.
        <br>13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a river of
        water; and it ran along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit.
        <br>14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at the head
        thereof I beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should
        go.
        <br>15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they
        should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.
        <br>16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of the fruit also.
        <br>17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the fruit also;
        wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see them.
        <br>18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come unto me and partake of the fruit.
        <br>19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I
        stood.
        <br>20 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by
        which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a
        world.
        <br>21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the
        path which led unto the tree by which I stood.
        <br>22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path which led to the tree.
        <br>23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness,
        insomuch that they who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost.
        <br>24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end
        of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even
        until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.
        <br>25 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were
        ashamed.
        <br>26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and
        spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
        <br>27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was
        exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come
        at and were partaking of the fruit.
        <br>28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them;
        and they fell away into forbidden paths and were lost.
        <br>29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.
        <br>30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught
        hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of
        iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
        <br>31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards that great and spacious building.
        <br>32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain; and many were lost from his
        view, wandering in strange roads.
        <br>33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building. And after they did enter into that
        building they did point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we heeded
        them not.
        <br>34 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen away.
        <br>35 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my father.
        <br>36 And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he
        said unto us, because of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea,
        he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord.
        <br>37 And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his
        words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto
        them.
        <br>38 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto them of many things, he bade them to keep
        the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease speaking unto them.

    <p id="1Nephi11">
        <br>1 For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the
        Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of
        the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had
        before set my foot.
        <br>2 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?
        <br>3 And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
        <br>4 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
        <br>5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.
        <br>6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the
        most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou
        believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.
        <br>7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore
        the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye
        witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
        <br>8 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like
        unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and
        the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.
        <br>9 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me
        the tree which is precious above all.
        <br>10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
        <br>11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof—for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I
        beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he
        spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
        <br>12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not;
        for he had gone from before my presence.
        <br>13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I
        beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and
        white.
        <br>14 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said
        unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?
        <br>15 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.
        <br>16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
        <br>17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all
        things.
        <br>18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner
        of the flesh.
        <br>19 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried
        away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
        <br>20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.
        <br>21 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou
        the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?
        <br>22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the
        children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
        <br>23 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.
        <br>24 And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going
        forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.
        <br>25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God,
        which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the
        love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
        <br>26 And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the condescension of God!
        <br>27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the
        prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after
        he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the
        form of a dove.
        <br>28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes
        were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.
        <br>29 And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the
        Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not.
        <br>30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the
        heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.
        <br>31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among
        the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of
        diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they
        were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
        <br>32 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of
        God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and
        bear record.
        <br>33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.
        <br>34 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight
        against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.
        <br>35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious
        building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying:
        Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against
        the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
        <br>36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the
        world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again,
        saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against
        the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
